Thanks to Manuel Nunesa, Enrico Gerdinga, Frank McGroartyb, Mahesan Niranjana, and the [additional material]([url](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/425965/)https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/425965/)

The data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled based on the paper "Artificial Neural Networks in Fixed Income Markets for Yield Curve Forecasting" DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3144622

Assumptions, exclusions, and other tasks:

1. The missing data has been filled using the linear interpolation method.
2. The linear regression model takes in all the features.
3. The sliding window has not been exactly implemented to replicate the results. The results would have to be a screenshot of a window of choice.
4. The 795 generated features are based on the paper.
